React Native Fundamentals
Activity 1: Development Environment Setup

Objective: Set up your React-Native development environment.
Instructions:
1. Install Node.js and npm.
2. Install the React-Native CLI.
3. Set up Android Studio or Xcode for mobile emulation.
4. Create a new React-Native project using 'npx react-native init MyApp'.
5. Run the app on an emulator or physical device.

What challenges did you face during setup?
- errors with react-native-cli, missing template.config.js, and confusion between the old and new CLI.
- not clear at first how Expo Go relates to React Native.
- project didnâ€™t generate Android files until setup was corrected.
- errors running expo because scripts were blocked by execution policy.
- remote README.md caused rejection when pushing local commits.
